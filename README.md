# HLSVideoPlayer
Sample HLS Video player in Kotlin with mvvm

Note:
1. mvvm is partially implemented due to time constraint, so here is a scope for improvement
2. Local db is not available so that can also be added
3. Utils can be created as a part of code clean up
4. App has issues while changing config on screen rotation for video size, so it can be fixed here later on
5. Dependency injection can be added later
6. test cased can be added later
